File "User_Setup.h" for SSD1963 parallel 7 inch TFT display

- This file is used in the TFT_eSPI library

- Note: the USB port can only supply 500mA, the user must provide additional power to be able to utilize the screen brightness to its fullest. The 3.3V @ 200mA linear regulator consumes about 200mA at 5V (Part of the energy is lost as heat).
